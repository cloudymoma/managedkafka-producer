## Googel Cloud Managed Kafka Data Producer

### TL;DR
Purpose of this producer is used for Google Cloud Managed Kafka load test. Hence you could use that for sizing and cost estimation

Use this [dataflow consumer](https://github.com/cloudymoma/managedkafka-dataflow) to achieve best performance and retrieve stats information.

### Quickstart

#### Prerequisites, the Google Auth Server 

1. install the server

```shell
./authserver install
```

2. start the server

```shell
./authserver start
```

3. check server status

```shell
./authserver status
```

you could check `authserver.log` for running information and errors, or pass
`stop`, `restart` parameters accordingly for server controls.

#### Go Program build

##### code you need to change before build 

- `topicName` is the Kafka Topic you want to send to
- `"bootstrap.servers": "bootstrap.dingo-kafka.us-central1.managedkafka.du-hast-mich.cloud.goog:9092",` replace the value accordingly to your Kafka server
- *Optional*
  - `numPublishers` number of Kafka publishers concurrently
  - `numDataGenThreads` number of data generation threads, only increase the number if data pool is constantly empty which may potentially affect the publishing performance
  - `numWorkers` better to keep this same as `numPublishers`, this only pull the data from the pool and fill the data chanel, which is dedicated for each publisher

1. init the project (you only need to do that once)

```shell
make init
```

2. build the Golang code

```shell
make build
```

3. Dump the data
You should be able see a binary named `main` in the project root directory,
simply run it `./main` or `make run` 

`Ctr + C` to stop it
